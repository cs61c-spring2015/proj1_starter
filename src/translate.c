/* Writes instructions during the assembler's first pass to OUTPUT. The case
   for general instructions has already been completed, but you need to write
   code to translate the li and blt pseudoinstructions. Your pseudoinstruction 
   expansions should not have any side effects.

   NAME is the name of the instruction, ARGS is an array of the arguments, and
   NUM_ARGS specifies the number of items in ARGS.

   Error checking for regular instructions are done in pass two. However, for
   pseudoinstructions, you must make sure that ARGS contains the correct number
   of arguments. You do NOT need to check whether the registers / label are 
   valid, since that will be checked in part two.

   Also for li:
    - make sure that the number is representable by 32 bits. (Hint: the number 
        can be both signed or unsigned).
    - if the immediate can fit in the imm field of an addiu instruction, then
        expand li into a single addiu instruction. Otherwise, expand it into 
        a lui-ori pair.

   And for blt:
    - your expansion should use the fewest number of instructions possible.

   MARS has slightly different translation rules for li, and it allows numbers
   larger than the largest 32 bit number to be loaded with li. You should follow
   the above rules if MARS behaves differently.

   Use fprintf() to write. If writing multiple instructions, make sure that 
   each instruction is on a different line.

   Returns the number of instructions written (so 0 if there were any errors).

   The symbol table (SYMTBL) is given for any symbols that need to be resolved
   at this step. If a symbol should be relocated, it should be added to the
   relocation table (RELTBL), and the fields for that symbol should be set to
   all zeros. 

   You must perform error checking on all instructions and make sure that their
   arguments are valid. If an instruction is invalid, you should not write 
   anything to OUTPUT but simply return -1. MARS may be a useful resource for
   this step.

   Note the use of helper functions. Consider writing your own! If the function
   definition comes afterwards, you must declare it first (see translate.h).

   Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.
